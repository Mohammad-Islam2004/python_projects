## 📌 Project Overview

This project recommends movies by comparing their content (such as genres, keywords, cast, and overview) using **text vectorization** and **cosine similarity**. It provides an interactive web interface where users can select a movie and instantly get recommendations.

The application is designed for:
- Learning recommender system concepts
- Demonstrating Machine Learning skills
- Portfolio and deployment showcase

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Model Persistence:** Pickle  
- **Version Control:** Git & Git LFS  
- **Dataset:** TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Movie metadata is preprocessed and combined into a single text feature.
2. Text data is converted into numerical vectors using vectorization techniques.
3. **Cosine similarity** is calculated between movies.
4. When a user selects a movie, the system recommends the most similar movies.
5. Movie posters are fetched dynamically using the TMDB API.
